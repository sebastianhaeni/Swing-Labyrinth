Swing Labyrinth
============
This small student application can do the following:

* Load mazes from text file
* Show the shortest path to the exit (using a recursive method)
* Edit the labyrinth by clicking on the tiles
* Generate a new labyrinth (using a recursive method)
* Save the current labyrinth

Note: Disable "Fancy Graphics" when generating large mazes for better performance.
